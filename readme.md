> *"I've always wanted to 'work' at the post office on Judith Plains, but there was no way to make it official. This mod makes those little roleplay moments count with real income."*

<br>

**Turn any location on any map into a legitimate workplace.** Place a trigger, name it, set a wage and pay schedule, and earn income while you're "on the clock." Perfect for roleplayers who want their farmers to have side jobs, or anyone who wants to supplement their farm income with off-farm work.

## Features

**Placeable trigger zones** — invisible zones you drop anywhere on any map, indoors or outdoors. No 3D object cluttering your scenery, just a named work location. Zone radius is configurable per trigger from 1 m up to 300 m.

**Custom workplace names** — call it Post Office, Feed Mill, Grandpa's Workshop, or anything that fits your map and your roleplay.

**Three pay schedules** — choose per trigger how you get paid:
- **Hourly** — wage x in-game hours worked (classic time-on-clock pay)
- **Flat Rate** — a fixed amount paid out at the end of every shift, regardless of time spent
- **Daily** — wage x number of in-game days worked

**Time multiplier per trigger** — control how fast in-game time counts for wage calculation. Options: Auto (follows server game speed), x1 (real time), x3, x5, x10.

**Zone-leave penalty** — if you leave the trigger zone during a shift, a 10-second countdown appears in the HUD. Step back inside (or within 8 m of the zone edge) to cancel it. If the countdown expires the shift auto-ends and you receive only 20% of your accrued earnings.

**Shift tracking HUD** — while on shift a panel shows the active workplace, time elapsed, and current earnings in real time. Press `F7` to enter edit mode where you can drag and resize the panel; position and scale are saved per savegame.

**Workplace Manager (F4)** — a full list dialog showing all placed triggers with name, wage, pay schedule, and coordinates. Add, edit, or delete any trigger from one screen.

**Shift history log** — the last 50 completed shifts are recorded with workplace name, duration, payout, pay schedule, and in-game day.

**Persistent saves** — all trigger placements, names, wages, pay schedules, and HUD position survive game saves and reloads. Each savegame has its own independent set.

**Multiplayer** — each player tracks their own shift independently; earnings go into the shared farm account. All shift events are server-authoritative. Triggers are synced to clients on join/rejoin automatically.

**Optional integrations:**
- *FS25_NPCFavor* — completing shifts builds your relationship with the NPC you work for
- *FS25_WorkerCosts* — shift income is tracked alongside AI worker wages for a balanced economy view

Both integrations are silently skipped if those mods are not loaded.
